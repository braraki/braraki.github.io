# About

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) under [Prof. Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/), studying robotics and machine learning. I completed my Master's in Mechanical Engineering at MIT and my Bachelor of Science in Engineering Sciences (Mechanical) at Yale University.

# Research Interests

My work sits at the intersection of three fields -- formal logic, Bayesian inference, and reinforcement learning. The focus of my research is to develop algorithms for learning and planning using formal logic. In my research, I use formal logic to model tasks and rules. By incorporating models of rules into planning, it is possible to both learn the structure of the rules using Bayesian inference and to efficiently learn policies that satisfy the rules using reinforcement learning.

For my publications and a brief history of my research path, please take a look at the [Research page](/research/).
