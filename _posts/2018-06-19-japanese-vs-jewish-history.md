I recently had the opportunity to visit Israel, and while I was there I also finished reading a book on Jewish history. One of the few other countries whose history I am somewhat familiar with is Japan, and as I thought about Jewish history I found myself marveling at how completely different these two cultures' stories are. On the one hand, you have Japan, with a nearly inviolate homeland and an unbroken imperial lineage reputedly almost 2700 years old. On the other you have Judaism/Jewish culture, which has an even longer history than Japan and which experienced an almost 2000 exile from its homeland.
