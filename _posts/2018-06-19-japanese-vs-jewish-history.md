![Rise and Fall of American Growth]({{ "/assets/rise_and_fall_of_american_growth_cover.jpg" | absolute_url }})

One of the most thought-provoking books I've read in the past few years is *The Rise and Fall of American Growth*, by Robert Gordon. I first heard about the book in The Economist, and I decided to read it because it sounded like the type of book that would give me historical perspective and teach me how today’s technology came to be. It clocks in at around 660 pages (not including notes/annotations), and it’s a pretty dense read. It was a long slog.
