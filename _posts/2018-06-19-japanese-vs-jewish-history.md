I recently had the opportunity to visit Israel, and while I was there I also finished reading a book on Jewish history. One of the few other countries whose history I am somewhat familiar with is Japan, and as I thought about Jewish history I found myself marveling at how completely different these two cultures' stories are. On the one hand, you have Japan, with a nearly inviolate homeland and an unbroken imperial lineage reputedly almost 2700 years old. On the other you have Judaism/Jewish culture, which has an even longer history than Japan and which experienced an almost 2000 exile from its homeland.

|       | Jewish/Israeli culture | Japanese culture |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Language | 22 characters | 3 alphabets, including >2k kanji |
| Imperial Lineage | House of David, 22 rulers | Yamato Dynasty, 125 emperors (would be an overstatement to call them all rulers) |
| Years spent under foreign rule | 2431 years | 7 years |
| Religiosity | Religious; there is ONE god | Spiritual; pretty much no gods (I don't think anyone believes in the mythological ones?) |
| How they treat people | Honestly pretty rude and pushy | Overbearingly polite and formal |
| Natural disasters? | A little | A lot |
| Geography | Once though to be center of the world | Once thought to be edge of the world |
