![Rise and Fall of American Growth]({{ "/assets/rise_and_fall_of_american_growth_cover.jpg" | absolute_url }})

One of the most thought-provoking books I've read in the past few years is *The Rise and Fall of American Growth*, by Robert Gordon. I first heard about the book in The Economist, and I decided to read it because it sounded like the type of book that would give me historical perspective and teach me how today’s technology came to be. It clocks in at around 660 pages (not including notes/annotations), and it’s a pretty dense read. It was a long slog.

The book was worth reading, but barely so. What stands out about the book? Gordon gives the reader an extremely thorough history of consumer technology in the United States from 1870 to the present. He really makes you appreciate how primitive the way of life in the late 1800s was, and he drives home the impact that technologies that we now take for granted made on our forebearers.

> Much of the available descriptive literature on living conditions of 1870 portrays a dismal existence of week-long household drudgery for housewives and dangerous, backbreaking working conditions for husbands. Life was short, large families were crammed together in small living spaces, much food and clothing was home-produced, and such marketed goods as could be afforded were mainly raw food and dry goods—for example, fabrics for making clothes at home. (location 645)

> Towns and cities were entirely dependent on horses for transportation, construction, and distribution. In the geographically compact city of Boston in 1870, 250,000 citizens shared the streets with 50,000 horses. (location 1013)

> According to one calculation made in 1886, “a typical North Carolina housewife had to carry water 8 to 10 times each day. Washing, boiling, and rinsing a single load of laundry used about 50 gallons of water. Over the course of a year she walked 148 miles toting water and carried more than thirty-six tons of water.”

The primitive standard of living of the late 1800s makes the technological achievements of the early to mid 1900s all the more remarkable.

I was amazed by the rapidity with which important inventions transformed our lives – cars, radio, and TV are some of the most notable. I thought that the rollout of smartphones was historically fast, but radio for example was at least as fast. Other major mid-century changes were in household appliances, such as the washing machine, dishwasher, refrigerator, and all of the other things we use in the kitchen today. Life was also fundamentally transformed – and not just transformed, but improved – by the networking of the house – **sewerage, running water, electricity, gas, and telephone**. In recent years we have added internet to the mix, but no matter how important the internet is, it is not much compared to the combined important of sewerage, running water, electricity, gas, and telephone.

Gordon describes the evolution of many other innovations as well. For example, the country store of the 1870s gave way to catalogs such as Sears and Montgomery Ward. The catalogs were made possible by Rural Free Delivery and the emergence of Chicago as the nation’s railway hub. After the catalog came the department store, which brought all sorts of innovations such as browsing before purchasing and return policies. After that came mass-market retailers such as JC Penney’s, and after that came big-box stores like Walmart. I found this discussion very interesting because it puts Amazon into perspective. In some ways, Amazon is little different from the Sears catalog of the late 1800s.

Two final innovations that Gordon talks about – food and clothing. I was surprised that in the late 1800s, the typical American diet consisted of “hogs ‘n hominy” – pork and corn-based stuff. It was apparently high-calorie but extremely bland and low in some important nutrients. The turn of the century saw many new foods introduced, such as cereal (much better than hominy), and also much better food safety. Mid-century saw frozen foods (possible thanks to the freezer) and packaged foods. What innovation in food do we have nowadays? Organic, which is less an improvement and more a lack of unimprovement, and Soylent. The other innovation was in clothing. In the 1870s, women made their own clothes and men wore very simple clothes chosen from a limited selection. The invention of mills and new materials allowed fashion to blossom and for our clothing to get much more comfortable. Lastly, out-sourcing in the 70s and 80s made clothing much cheaper. In today’s world, we don’t have much innovation in clothing, besides maybe some waterproofed stuff. (We do have fast fashion now).

After all of the accomplishments of our past comes the list of our failures after 1970. I was really surprised by some of the statistics Gordon mentioned. For example,

> **Average real income in the bottom 90 percent was actually lower in 2013 than it was in 1972**. In fact, peak real income for the bottom 90 percent of $37,053 in 2000 was barely higher than the $35,411 achieved in 1972, and by 2013, that average had declined from 2000 by 15 percent to $31,652. Meanwhile, the average real income for the top 10 percent doubled from $161,000 in 1972 to $324,000 in 2007, followed by a modest retreat to $273,000 in 2013.

> In the case of the automotive parts industry, the effects of globalization included a decline in median wages from $18.35 in 2003 to $15.83 per hour in 2013

No wonder Trump won the Rust Belt in 2016. Furthermore, maybe some of his anti-trade policies may be, if not totally stupid, then at least slightly on the right path:

> Three factors stressed by Goldin and Margo as supports for the compression were the rise of unionization and decline of both trade and immigration.

In other words, we experienced a decline in inequality during the 50s and 60s thanks to unionization and a decline in trade and immigration. Although the big business bosses definitely aren’t going to let unionization make a comeback, there is perhaps an economic argument for limiting trade and immigration. Even if overall it hurts the economy, it would possibly help some of those in the Rust Belt (although automation is taking away their jobs at least as quickly as globalization is).

Moreover, for those of us who think that technology will save the economy – well, we’re wrong. **Even if technology were to double in its productivity, it only makes up 7% of the economy.** That sure puts things in perspective.

> Total business and household spending on all electronic entertainment, communications, and information technology (including purchases of TV and audio equipment and cell phone service plans) amounted in 2014 to only about 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

Cons

Now for the cons. I disagreed with a lot of the book. I really think that Gordon is overly pessimistic about technology and doesn’t realize the potential of future technologies, particularly “AI” (although his pessimism is a nice antidote to the over-hyping of many others). Just as a first example, the fact that the book was published in 2015 instead of 2016 means that major new companies such as Uber and AirBnB aren’t even mentioned in the book. Of self-driving cars, he says:

> This category of future progress is demoted to last place because it offers benefits that are minor compared to the invention of the car itself or the improvements in safety that have created a tenfold improvement in fatalities per vehicle mile since 1950. (location 11481)

Gordon’s ignorance of the possible transformative effects of the self-driving car blew my mind. Self-driving cars, if they really come to be, will be AT LEAST as transformative as the invention of the car itself. First of all, they will completely eliminate/transform several important occupations such as truck drivers, delivery drivers (from packages to pizza), and taxi drivers.  They will enable far more people to not own a car, instead summoning self-driving cars on-demand. They will make traffic congestion much lighter and eliminate the need for parking lots in crowded city centers. They will probably change where people live, allowing people both to live in city centers and in exurbs more easily. Tens or hundreds of millions of people spend hours every day commuting in their cars, and self-driving cars will free up their time. It makes me feel as though Gordon either completely lacks imagination or is willfully ignoring the possible positive consequences of self-driving cars in order to further his thesis.

He says that many other technologies that have transformed our lives, particularly smartphones and social media, haven’t even registered as a blip in the productivity data. At first I thought, wow, maybe our new technologies really aren’t that great compared to inventions of the past. In fact, certain technologies such as social media may have lowered our productivity. But then I thought about it more. Smartphones have completely transformed the way we live. We all have the potential to carry our camera, personal library, music player, portal to the internet, and GPS tracker as well as our phone with us wherever we are with our smartphones. If that doesn’t show up in the productivity data, then maybe our current technologies are even MORE under-represented in the GDP data than the technologies of the past were (although Gordon argues persuasively that older technological revolutions such as the automobile were also seriously underrepresented at first). One thing about newer technologies is that they are relatively inaccessible to older people. Robert Gordon is an older person. I think that he doesn’t fully appreciate how much the internet and other silicon-based technologies have transformed people’s lives. (That wasn't an ad hominem, it's just a theory!)

Another thing that Gordon underappreciates is the potential of AI. Sure, AI may lead to nothing, or only to incremental improvements. But AI (and maybe robotics (I'm not biased at all)) has the potential to overhaul a major segment of the economy that has so far been relatively untouched by technology – services. Services make up 70% of the US economy, and as Gordon points out, one barber is still limited to cutting one person’s hair at a time; one cleaner is still limited to cleaning one house at a time. That may very well change with AI and robotics. Gordon doesn’t seem to appreciate that AI has the potential to overhaul the 70% of the economy that has so far been relatively un-productivized by technology.

That said, even if technology continues to progress at a rapid rate, the US economy is going to struggle in the coming decades.

> The combined effects of growing inequality, a faltering education system, demographic headwinds, and the strong likelihood of a fiscal correction imply that the real median disposable income will grow much more slowly in the future than in the past.

In some ways, it will be easier to develop AI and robotics than it will be to fix inequality, the education system, our aging population, and fiscal irresponsibility.

Another thing I was skeptical about was Gordon’s explanation of productivity growth. He says that the country experienced two spurts of productivity growth, from 1940-1960 and a much smaller one from 1994-2004. He says that the first was because of a number of factors, mainly thanks to the Great Depression, which encouraged firms to use fewer works and encouraged workers to unionize, and WWII, which forced firms to hugely expand their output while using a reduced workforce, and also triggered massive government investment in industry. I believe these things. He says that the 1994-2004 productivity boomlet was caused by the internet / computers. I agree with this too. BUT, I am still left wondering. Perhaps the US grew quickly in the 50s and 60s thanks to the fact that Europe, China and Japan were all bombed out and we were literally the only intact power left in the world. Perhaps the US grew quickly from 1994-2004 because the Soviet Union had just collapsed and we were experiencing peace dividends. Maybe the story is bigger than just technology.

This brings me to the final complaint I can remember: the book is too limited in scope. I don’t know if it would be realistic for a book to have an expanded scope – maybe a series of books would have to be written. But Gordon mostly focuses on consumer technology  – industrial technology is almost entirely overlooked. International trade is mostly overlooked. I wish that he had further analyzed WHY consumer technology was able to progress so rapidly form 1870 to 1970. It depended on Maxwell’s equations, the discovery of oil, the mining of iron, etc etc. These things get 0 coverage. It would have been very interesting if Gordon had the scientific and engineering background to analyze the scientific discoveries of the past two centuries and explain why it was so much easier to achieve rapid growth back then and so much harder now. For example, we are still making basic discoveries in, say, particle physics, but they seem far from ever translating into anything commercial. Why is this? What technologies are currently limiting our advancement? I would argue materials science is a major limiting factor – thanks to slow progress in materials science, buildings and batteries have stagnated. Biological technology is a limiting factor – the pace of biology research is painstakingly slow, in large part because the tools they use are primitive. I wish that Gordon could have talked about this aspect of the limitations on American productivity growth.

Anyway, Gordon talked about all sorts of ailments that our society is currently suffering from. How might we improve our country’s prognosis? According to Gordon, we need to improve education and access to college. We can’t boost productivity with an uneducated workforce. We need to reduce inequality by taxing the rich more, raising the minimum wage, and introducing free preschool education. He lists more suggestions in the postscript chapter.

Lastly, I was pleased to find that Bill Gates wrote a review of the book. He shares Gordon’s admiration of America’s past technological progress, but unlike Gordon, he is predictably very optimistic about technology’s impact on the future. Since Bill Gates is probably one of the most biased people to have an opinion on the greatness of technology, I don’t buy Gates’ optimistic belief in technology, although I am a bit more optimistic than Gordon.

Bonus: Daniela gets quoted twice! 😀

> Daniela Rus, Director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, provides a summary of some of the limitations of the robots developed to date. Robotic reasoning is limited, and “the scope of the robot’s reasoning is entirely contained in the program…. Tasks that humans take for granted—for example, answering the question, ‘Have I been here before?’—are extremely difficult for robots.” Further, if a robot encounters a situation that it has not been specifically programmed to handle, “it enters an error state and stops operating.”

> In the words of computer expert Rus:   So far, that level of autonomous driving performance has been possible only in low-speed, low-complexity environments. Robotic vehicles cannot yet handle all the complexities of driving “in the wild,” such as inclement weather and complex traffic situations. These issues are the focus of ongoing research.
