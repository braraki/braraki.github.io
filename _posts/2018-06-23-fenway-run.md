Part of my Harvard med school run last week brought me by Fenway, and it made me want to run around Fenway this week. So that's what I did. Fenway is a really nice park that goes along a small river/fen. It's a great run because you go through dense urban environments and wooded park areas. You get to see everything from Fenway Park, the Boston skyline, the Museum of Fine Arts, and busy soccer fields to community gardens, the river, and peaceful semi-forested paths.

Also, the run was 6 miles long, and my pace was almost 9 min/mile, which I'm pleasantly surprised by. Hopefully I'll try a 7-mile run next week, since I'm pretty sure I had another mile in the tank after my run today.
