I went to the Harvard Med School campus for a Shabbat dinner last week, and I was amazed at the scale of the Longwood medical area. It's practically an entire district of the city devoted to medicine and medical education. What surprised me almost as much was that after years of running around Boston, I had never checked this area out.

So, I checked out the Longwood area today. Unfortunately, it's kind of far away, so I couldn't explore it as thoroughly as I would have liked because I can't run that much. My run today was 5 miles long, and that's pretty much the upper limit of what I can do right now. Here's a glamour shot of the HMS campus:

The Longwood area doesn't look like that at all though. It's mostly just lots of big blocky buildings on streets with surprisingly spacious sidewalks. There are a ton of colleges and hospitals packed into the area, including HMS, Simmons College, Emmanuel College, Beth Israel, Boston Children's Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Hospital. It's crazy how they're all packed right next to each other. Looking at the map now, one thing I notice I missed was the Wyss Institute. Since I worked at the Wyss Institute by the Harvard College campus, I wish I could have checked that area out. Maybe next time!

I also ran through a lot of Fenway. It's really nice in the summer. I think that my next long run will be around Fenway.
