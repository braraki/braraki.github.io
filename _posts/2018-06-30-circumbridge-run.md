![Circumbridge Run]({{ "/assets/circumbridge_run_6_30_18.png" | absolute_url }})

I tried out a 7.2-mile run today. I'm calling it the "Circumbridge" run because it looped around most of Cambridge. The issue with the run today, I think, is that I decided to run at the hottest time of one of the hottest days so far this summer (it was 91Â°F), so I was kind of dying the whole time. I had to take a long break in the middle to recover, but I guess a bonus is that I got to drink the best Tropicana Raspberry Lemonade of my life. My pace excluding the break was 9:50 min/mile. I'll probably take a break from long runs next week, since apparently it's standard to do a long run only once every two weeks.
