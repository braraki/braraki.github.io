I'm just checking out how to make posts right now.

These posts use [Markdown][markdown]. I've _never used_ markdown before but it seems pretty awesome. I **need to learn** how to use it though.

Here's a list of things I need to figure about before I start making control theory posts.

1. How to use Markdown
2. How to use Jekyll

Yeah... that's it pretty much actually. I just need to play around with these things and get the hang of them.

`Here's some inline code`

|even|make|tables|
(not very well though)

I also added MathJax so let's see if these equations work:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Here's matrix multiplication:

\begin{align}
	\begin{pmatrix} 
		1 & 0 \\\ 
		0 & e^{i\pi} \\\ \tag{2.2}
	\end{pmatrix}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	  u \\\ v
	\end{pmatrix}
	&=
	\begin{pmatrix}
	  u \\\ -v
	\end{pmatrix} \\\ 
	\large\equiv \\\   
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\\
		0 & -1 \\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x \\\ y
	\end{bmatrix}
	&= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x \\\ -y
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
