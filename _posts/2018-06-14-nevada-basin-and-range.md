For better or worse, I have flown on many, many transcontinental flights over the years. One thing I have found impossible to miss is Nevada's bizarre terrain. When you fly over Nevada, you see mountain range after mountain range, all oriented in a north-south direction. Despite being intrigued by these ranges, I always just took it for granted that Nevada, and the American West in general, is full of dry, rugged, forbidding terrain and never thought more of it.

Well, I'm now reading a very interesting 'pop' geology book called *Annals of the Former World* by John McPhee, and part of this sprawling yet enthralling book is a section on the Basin and Range formations of Nevada. According to the book, Nevada was once pretty flat, but around 17 million years ago the crust started to separate and thin in a west-east direction. This caused the crust to kind of pull apart into long, thin north-south blocks. These blocks then tilted, the parts going up forming mountain ranges and the parts going down forming basins. So that's how it happened!

Adding further intrigue is the fact that this is part of the islandification of California (at least according to the book... I can't find anything about it online). According to the book, it is likely that the separating crust, which has already formed basins through for example Death Valley, Walker Lake, and Carson Sink, will eventually unleash the ocean all the way through Nevada and apparently "connect with a transform fault coming in from Cape Mendocino".

Bonus Fact: The thin crust of Nevada allowed lots of hot water from the crust to boil up to the surface. It turns out that the process by which most heavier elements are transported to the surface of the earth is by dissolving into hot water and then being carried by the water to the surface. As the water cools and evaporates it deposits the heavy elements into the surface rock. In the Basin and Range Province, this resulted in huge numbers of 'supergene enrichments' of silver (as well as other metals), making that region one of the richest sources of silver in the world.
